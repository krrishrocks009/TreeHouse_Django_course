DIY, or Do It Yourself, custom template tags! Build a template tag that will provide you with a link to the newest course in our library at all times.

template is Django's module for all things template-related. We'll use this several times in the course.

template.Library is a class that lets us register new tags and filters through an instance of itself.

register.simple_tag(tag_name) or @register.simple_tag - Registers a function as a simple tag. Simple tags don't include new templates, don't have an end tag, and don't assign values to context variables.

Write a more complicated template tag; one that returns a dictionary and has a more complex implementation.

register.inclusion_tag("tag_template.html")(tag_name) or @register.inclusion_tag("tag_template.html") - Registers an inclusion tag. Inclusion tags render a template into wherever they're used.
