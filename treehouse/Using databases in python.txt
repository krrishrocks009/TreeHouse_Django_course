Using Databases in Python:

New Terms: Modeling

model - A code object that represents a database table
SqliteDatabase - The class from Peewee that lets us connect to an SQLite database
Model - The Peewee class that we extend to make a model
CharField - A Peewee field that holds onto characters. It's a varchar in SQL terms
max_length - The maximum number of characters in a CharField
IntegerField - A Peewee field that holds an integer
default - A default value for the field if one isn't provided
unique - Whether the value in the field can be repeated in the table
.connect() - A database method that connects to the database
.create_tables() - A database method to create the tables for the specified models.
safe - Whether or not to throw errors if the table(s) you're attempting to create already exist.

New Terms:Queries

.create() - creates a new instance all at once
.select() - finds records in a table
.save() - updates an existing row in the database
.get() - finds a single record in a table
.delete_instance() - deletes a single record from the table
.order_by() - specify how to sort the records
if __name__ == '__main__' - a common pattern for making code only run when the script is run and not when it's imported
db.close() - not a method we used, but often a good idea. Explicitly closes the connection to the database.
.update() - also something we didn't use. Offers a way to update a record without .get() and .save(). Example: Student.update(points=student['points']).where(Student.username == student['username']).execute()

New Terms:Data Entry

TextField() - a field that holds a blob of text of any size
DateTimeField() - a field for holding a date and a time
/usr/bin/env what?

If you're not sure what to put after /usr/bin/env, test it out in your terminal program.

Type in /usr/bin/env python and you should get a Python shell like normal. If it says 2.7 or something other than the 3.4 you should be expecting, try /usr/bin/env python3. Whichever of these gets you the correct Python shell is the one you should put at the top of your file.

New terms:

OrderedDict - a handy container from the collections module that works like a dict but maintains the order that keys are added
.__doc__ - a magic variable that holds the docstring of a function, method, or class

CRUD::

New terms: Add An Entry

sys - a Python module that contains functionality for interacting with the system
sys.stdin - a Python object that represents the standard input stream. In most cases, this will be the keyboard

View and Search Entries:
New terms

.where() - method that lets us filter our .select() results
.contains() - method that specifies the input should be inside the specified field

strftime--check in web

New terms::Clean Up

os - Python module that lets us integrate with the underlying OS
os.name - attribute that holds a name for the style of OS
os.system() - method to allow Python code to call OS-level programs
