One of Django's jaw dropping features is its built-in, auto-generated admin panel.

python manage.py createsuperuser will create a new superuser, or a user that's allowed to log into the admin area with all permissions.

admin.site.register(Model) will register a model with the default admin site, which allows you to edit instances of that model in the admin.
