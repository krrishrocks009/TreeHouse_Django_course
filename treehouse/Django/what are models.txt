Django's ORM, like many others, uses classes to define a database table, and that class's attributes to define the columns in the table. We call these classes "models".

django.db.models has most of the model functionality you'll use to create models and their fields.

DateTimeField holds datetime objects.

CharField holds strings.

TextField holds an unspecified amount of text.

More Django model field types.
