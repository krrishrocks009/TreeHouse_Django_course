We get to our model data through our views so they're equally important to test. Bonus, we can test our URLs at the same time.

django.core.urlresolvers.reverse() takes a URL name and reverses it to the correct URL string. More information

self.client acts like a web browser and lets you make requests to URLs, both inside and outside of your Django project.

assertEqual(a, b) checks that a and b are equal to each other.

assertIn(a, b) checks that a is contained in b.
