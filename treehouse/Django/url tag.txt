We need to use links in our web app, but what if our URLs change? Django gives us a handy way around that.

{% url 'path.to.view' %} to link to a view who's URL doesn't have a name.

Note: This has been removed in Django 1.10 and beyond. If you want to use this feature, be sure to install Django 1.9 or below. You can do that with pip install django<1.10. Better yet, name all of your URLs as shown below.

url(r'pattern', views.view, name='list') to name an URL

{% url 'list' %} to link to a named URL

include('courses.urls', namespace='course') to namespace a group of URLs

{% url 'courses:list' %} to link to a named and namespaced URL
