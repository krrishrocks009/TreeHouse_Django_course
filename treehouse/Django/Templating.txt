Views that return plain text are fine, but eventually we're going to want some fancy HTML.


App-specific templates are best kept in a structure like app_name/templates/app_name because Django looks in app directories for a directory named templates and makes those templates automatically available.

{{ and }} are used to mark a variable you want printed out.

{% and %} mark template tags, or special bits of Python that Django's template engine knows how to run. Unlike Jinja2 templates, you can't just run arbitrary Python in a template.

render() turns a request object, a template, and an optional context dictionary into a generated string. More about render.

Template Inheritence:

Templates work better when they work together.

{% extends <template> %} - Template tag to specify which template the current one should inherit from.

{% block <name> %} and {% endblock %} - Template tag pair to mark a section of a parent template as overridable.


STATIC Assests:

After we get HTML into the mix, we're going to want some CSS.

STATICFILES_DIRS is a setting for where to find static files. These files will either be served during development or will end up being collected by the collectstatic command during deployment.

staticfiles_urlpatterns() is a function that returns the URL patterns for static files based on DEBUG and a few other settings. You import it from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls.

IntegerField is a field that holds integers, or whole numbers.

An inline is a smaller form inside of a larger form. The smaller form represents a related record in the database.

StackedInline is an inline where each field takes up the full width of the form. Fields are stacked.

TabularInline is an inline where each field is part of a single row for the form.
