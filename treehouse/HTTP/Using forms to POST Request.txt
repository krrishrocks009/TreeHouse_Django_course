Using Forms for POST Requests8:32


HTML Forms with File Uploads

The HTML for a form that includes a file upload is slightly different. Specifically, there are two changes:

An input element with the type "file" is added, and
The encryption type of the form element must be set to "multipart/form-data"
Here is how the HTML might look:

<form method="post" action="/update_profile" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="text" name="handle">
  <input type="file" name="avatar">
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
When the form is submitted, the request looks something like the following:

POST /update_profile HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----TH23XJ
Content-Length: 34209

------TH23XJ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="handle"

treehouse
------TH23XJ
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="me.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[binary data of file]
------TH23XJ
Notice that the data is transmitted in parts, which explains the "multipart/form-data" encryption type of the form, as well as the resulting and identical content-type header.
